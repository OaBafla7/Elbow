# Elbow
Design an Elbow for Robot Arm
This project features a custom 3D-printed servo motor mount bracket, designed for securely holding a standard micro servo motor (e.g., SG90 or MG90S). The design includes curved cable management arms and precise mounting holes to align and fasten your servo in place.

üñºÔ∏è Overview
This mount was created for robotics or automation projects requiring:

Stable positioning of a micro servo motor

Clean cable routing

Easy integration with frames or chassis via side mounting holes

üìê Design Features
Material: Recommended PLA, PETG, or ABS (3D-printable plastics)

Servo Fit: Designed for SG90/MG90S micro servos

Mounting Holes:

4 bottom holes for servo attachment

2 side holes for securing the bracket to a frame or panel

Rounded Cable Channels: 4 vertically curved channels to guide servo wires, reducing wear and improving aesthetics

Wall Thickness: Optimized for lightweight but rigid support
